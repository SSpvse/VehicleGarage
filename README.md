This is just showcasting some of the techneques that need to be used in the exam.

Objects within objects as fields.
When you create an object (A) you can instantiate another within it or you send object B through as argument into object A via constructors.

Showing that you can use objects B/C that are inside object A, for expample the engine/wheels through object Car/Bike
  - Car car = new Car(engine, wheel, tires)
  - car.turnOnEngine() etc.
